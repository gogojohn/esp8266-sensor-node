   a Wi-Fi network. The values below, by default, are populated with
   placeholders. These (of course) should be updated, to contain the
   values specific to the network that the node will be connecting to.

   NOTE: *do not* commit any versions of this file, that contain
   actual credentials. That would be bad.
